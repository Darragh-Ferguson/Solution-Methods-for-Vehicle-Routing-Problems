# Solution-Methods-for-Vehicle-Routing-Problems
My MMath Dissertation at the University of Edinburgh 2024 exploring the HF-VRP-DL. I extended this formulation to the multi depot version and introduced a Savings Algorithm for the single depot formulation.
Many thanks to my supervisor Sergio Garcia Quilles for his help and guidance on this project.
