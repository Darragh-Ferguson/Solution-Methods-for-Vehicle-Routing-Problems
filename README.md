# Solution-Methods-for-Vehicle-Routing-Problems
My MMath (Mathematics 2024) Dissertation at the University of Edinburgh exploring the HF-VRP-DL (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2022.106024). I extended this formulation to the multi depot version and introduced a Savings Algorithm for the single depot formulation.
Many thanks to my supervisor Sergio Garcia Quilles for his help and guidance on this project.
